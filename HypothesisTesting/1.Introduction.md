# Hypothesis Testing Overview

A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference used to decide whether data in hand sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis.

Hypothesis testing allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters.

## Null and Alternative Hypotheses

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: In simple terms, the null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant effect (e.g., relationship) between the variables being studied.
  - A simple null hypothesis says nothing new is happening.
  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It asserts that there is a significant effect between the variables being studied.
  - Example:
    - Null hypothesis: H0: Average video duration (μ) ≤ 6 minutes
    - Alternative hypothesis: H1: Average video duration (μ) > 6 minutes

## Importance of Hypothesis Testing

We try to gather evidence to reject the null hypothesis. If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, it doesn't necessarily mean that the null hypothesis is true; it simply means that there isn't enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

### Additional Notes

- When you look at the table, you may ask: **What is the p-value and what is its significance?**
  - You would be looking for the t-statistical value, and each t-statistic is associated with a p-value.
