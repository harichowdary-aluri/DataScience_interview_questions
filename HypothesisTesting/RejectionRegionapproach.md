# Hypothesis Testing Approaches

There are two main approaches for hypothesis testing:

1. **Rejection Region Approach**
2. **p-value Approach**

### Rejection Region Approach Steps

1. **Formulate a Null and Alternative Hypothesis**
   - Example:
     - Null hypothesis (μ = 6 minutes)
     - Alternative hypothesis (μ > 6 minutes)

2. **Decide a Significance Level**
   - This is generally a probability of rejecting the null hypothesis.
   - Example levels: α = 0.05 (5%), or α = 0.01 (1%).

3. **Check the Assumptions**
   - How  the data is distributed?
   - do we have population Standard deviation or not.
   - Are we working with a single data column or multiple columns?
   - what type of data are we working with

4. **Decide on the Appropriate Test**
   - Common tests include:
     1. Z-test
     2. T-test
     3. Chi-square test
     4. ANOVA test

5. **State the Relevant Test Statistic**
   - For Z-test: Calculate the Z-score and compare against the Z-statistic.
   - For T-test: Calculate the T-value and compare against the T-statistic
6. **Perform the Test**
7. **Reject or accept the Null Hypothesis**
