# One-Sided vs Two-Sided Tests

### Key Concepts:

1. **One-Sided Test (One-Tailed Test)**
   - Used when the researcher is interested in testing the effect in a specific direction.
   - For example, testing if a value is greater than or less than a threshold.

2. **Two-Sided Test (Two-Tailed Test)**
   - Used when we are interested in testing the effect in both directions.
   - For example, testing if a value is simply different from a threshold, regardless of whether it is higher or lower.

### Visual Representation:
- **One-Sided Test**: The rejection region is only on one side of the distribution (either left or right).
- **Two-Sided Test**: The rejection region is on both sides of the distribution, capturing both possible extremes.

### Example
- In a hypothesis test, if we want to determine whether a value is significantly greater than a known value, we use a one-sided test.
- If we want to determine if there is any significant difference, either greater or lesser, we use a two-sided test.
